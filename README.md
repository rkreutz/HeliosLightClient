[Helios](https://github.com/a16z/helios) is a fully trustless, efficient, 
and portable Ethereum light client written in Rust.

Helios converts an untrusted centralized RPC endpoint into a safe 
unmanipulable local RPC for its users. It syncs in seconds, requires no 
storage, and is lightweight enough to run on mobile devices.

This is a macOS client app on top of Helios.
